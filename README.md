# Cluster

Cluster is a web platform for shared wallets built on the Stellar ecosystem, allowing groups of friends, teams, and communities to manage collective funds in a simple, secure, and transparent way. Unlike an individual wallet, Cluster offers native multisig, ensuring that transactions only occur with the authorization defined by the group.

# Proposal

The proposal is to create circles of trust in crypto, where each wallet can have multiple participants with distinct roles: administrators, contributors, or viewers. The collective dashboard displays balances, contributions, and withdrawals, while the entire transaction history remains immutably recorded on the Stellar ledger.

# Architecture

The architecture combines Node.js on the backend (API + Stellar SDK), Rust for smart contracts, and PostgreSQL for off-chain management of users and permissions. On the frontend, the interface can be built with HTML, CSS, and JS, or with React for greater fluidity.

# Differential

Cluster prioritizes security with encrypted login, two-factor authentication (2FA), and full audit of operations. Its differential lies in combining modern usability with the power of Stellar, creating a practical solution for groups that want to manage crypto assets collaboratively and reliably.
